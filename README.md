# Context

This fork is a snapshot of the private repository at the end of my internship. It is more recent than the public GitHub repository. However, I will not support this fork. It also contains my internship report (in french) if you want more details about my work in this project.

There are two branches: master and new_tests. The last branch contains work on meson I didn't have time to finish.
